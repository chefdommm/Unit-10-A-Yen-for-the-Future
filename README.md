## Background Information
---
In this assignment, I had to test  the many time series tools that I learned in to predict future movements in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the Japanese yen.
The following tasks were required:

### 1) Time series forecasting
### 2) Linear regression modelling

## Requirements
---
### 1) Time-Series Forecasting
I had to load historical CAD-JPY exchange rate data and apply time series analysis and modelling to determine if there is any predictable behavior.
### The following was completed


- Plot the Settle price to check for long or short-term patterns.

- recognize  any patterns, long-term and/or short?



- Preform Decomposition using a Hodrick-Prescott filter (decompose the settle price into trend and noise).

- tried to visualize any patterns, long-term and/or short?







- I had to Forecast the exchange rate price using an ARIMA model.

- I had to analyze the model and forecast what will happen to the Japanese Yen in the near term



- I had to Forecast the  volatility with GARCH.

- Had to analyze the model forecast for volatility in the near term



- I used the results of the completed time series analysis and modelling to answer given questions.




### 2) Linear Regression Forecasting
I built a Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict CAD/JPY returns with lagged CAD/JPY futures returns and categorical calendar seasonal effects.

### The following was completed

- Data preparation (creating returns and lagged returns, and splitting the data into training and testing data)
- Fitting a linear regression model.
- Making predictions using the testing data.
- Out-of-sample performance.
- In-sample performance.

- I had to use the results of the linear regression analysis and modelling to answer given questions.
